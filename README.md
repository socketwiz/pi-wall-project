This project is based heavily on https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate.
I built it from the gound up using my own opinions on what libraries to use but
consulted the react-boilerplate projects on how to create the generators and
various other areas.  This project was built to suite my own needs. I expect 
most people might prefer react-boilerplate as a more complete solution.
